#### What is this?
This is the backend for the petiful client, the get end points for each animal shows you the start of the queue, which is the only animal you can adopt out of the queue. The delete endpoint "adopts" the animal, which dequeues the animal from the queue.
#### Tech stack for the back end
 1. Node.js
 2. Express.js

#### Data structures used.
We used a queue for each animal type so that users can only see and adopt animals that have been there for the longest.
